# green_iguana_16SdietXimmunity
Analysis of 16S metaborcode sequences from the gut microbiome of green iguanas during an experiment meant to assess the effects of a high sugar diet paired with an immune challenge.

The data files needed to replicate the analysis are included here. The raw sequences have been deposited to NCBI SRA (BioProject PRJNA1129137).
